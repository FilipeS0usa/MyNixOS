# This is my NixOS configuration

It's still a work in progress but I will make it better in the long run.

This is a modular aproach of aplying my NixOS configuration, you can use it at will.


# Some NOTES

This repository will not have the file hardware-configurations.nix and secret.nix.
Since these files are too personal, it depends on each system I will let them off of this project.

You can always just copy your hardware-configuration.nix and create your secret.nix. to be able to run it.

The place where you should put your `hardware-configuration.nix` and your `secret.nix` is the following path `hosts/yourHost/`.
